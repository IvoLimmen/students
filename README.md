# Students

Just a simple application to see how to build something in Crystal.

## Build

    shards build

This will output an application called `students`. Run it with:

    ./students

When you type `end` it will show the averages per course per student.

## Evaluation

The good:

* I am not used to the Ruby/Crystal programming style but I like it so far.
* I like the shards build tool.
* I like the fast compiling.
* Everything is an object.

The bad:

* Documentation is not super. Tutorial is fine but no class documentation (needed to read the code)

The ugly:

* None!
